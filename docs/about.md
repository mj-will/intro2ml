Intro2ML aims to introduce you to some of the basic concepts of machine learning through examples. There is a focus on applications of neural networks though others methods will hopefully be added in the future. Each lesson is numbered and builds on the previous.

This project is still in its infancy and any feedback/contributions are much appreciated and can be sent via email or twitter.

All the notebooks and this site are hosted in a [git repository](https://github.com/mj-will/intro2ml).
